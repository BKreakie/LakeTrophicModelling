Dear Dr. Silver,

Please accept for your review the submission, "Modelling Lake Trophic State: A Random Forest Approach" to be published in Freshwater Science.  In this article we detail our use of Random Forests to model trophic state in lakes across the United States.  This research makes three important contributions to the literature.  First, most prior modelling studies of lake trophic state have focused on a limited number of lakes that span local or regional extents.  Our models are built for lakes that span the conterminous United States and allow for more general statements to be made.   Second, we compare models with and without *in situ* water quality data and find that our models provide reliable predictions using broadly available data.  This allows for predictions to be made in nearly every lakes in the U.S.  Third, we utilize a data mining algorithm, Random Forests, to build our model.  Random Forest models have been shown by many to provide better and less biased predictions that most other modeling methodologies.  In short, we feel this paper builds on past work by expanding the extent and by using improved methods. 


The letter should describe the extent to which data, text, or illustrations have been used in existing or forthcoming papers or books, 

The letter must attest to the bona fide nature of data used in the study that exist only on a website and must describe steps taken for quality control. The URL must be provided in the manuscript. Authors should be able to provide a hard copy of the data on request.

and should state an ability to pay page charges if the paper is published. 

Sincerely,
