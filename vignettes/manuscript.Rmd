##Introduction
Cyanobacteria are an important taxonomic group associated with harmful algal blooms in lakes. Understanding the drivers of cyanobacteria presence has important implications for lake management and for
 the protection of human and ecosystem health.  Chlorophyll a concentration, a measure of the biological productivity of a lake, is one such driver and is largely, although not exclusively, determined
 by nutrient inputs.   As nutrient inputs increase, productivity increases and lakes transition from low trophic state (e.g. oligotrophic) to higher trophic states (e.g. hypereutrophic).  These broad
trophic state classifications are associated with ecosystem health and ecosystem services/disservices (e.g. recreation, aesthetics, fisheries, and harmful algal blooms).  Thus, models of trophic state
 might be used to predict things like cyanobacteria.

We have three goals for this preliminary research:

1. Build and assess models of lake trophic state
2. Assess ability to predict trophic state in lakes without available *in situ* water quality data
3. Explore association between cyanobacteria and trophic in order to expand models.

##Data and Modeling Methods

**Data**
We utilize four primary sources of data for this study. These are outlined below and in Table 1.

1. National Lakes Assessment (NLA) 2007: The NLA data were collected during the summer of 2007 and the final data were released in 2009.  With consistent methods and metrics collected at 1056 location
s across the conterminous United States (Map 1), the NLA provides a unique opportunity to examine broad scale patterns in lake productivity.  The NLA collected data on biophysical measures of lake wat
er quality and habitat.  For this analysis we primarily examined the water quality measurements from the NLA [@usepa2009national].
2. National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) 2006: The NLCD is a nationally collected land use land cover dataset.  We collected total land use land cover and total percent impervious surface within a 3 kilo
meter buffer surrounding the lake to examine larger landscape-level effects [@homer2004development;@xian2009updating].
3. Modeled lake morphometry: Various measures of lake morphometry (i.e. depth, volume, fetch, etc.) are important in understanding lake productivity, yet many of these data are difficult to obtain for
 large numbers of lakes over broad regions.  To add this information we modeled lake morphometry [@hollister2010volume;@hollister_predicting_2011;@Lakmorpho2014;@NLMDInPrep].
4. Estimated Cyanobacteria Biovolumes: Cyanobacteria biovolumes is a truer measure of Cyanobacteria dominance than abundance as there is great variability in the size within and between species.  To a
ccount for this, Beaulieu *et al.* [-@beaulieu2013nutrients] used literature values to estimate biovolumes for the taxa in the NLA.  They shared this data and we have summed that information on a per-
lake basis.
